## Part 1

Choose a **simple task** you want an AI to help with (e.g., writing a poem, solving a coding problem, summarizing an article, etc.).

### Answer

#### Simple task: Poem (e.g)

**Init Prompt:**
```
Write a poem about the beauty of nature.
```

**Example notes/idears:**
- What is the task you want the AI to perform?
    - e.g., "Write a poem short about the beauty of nature.", "Summarize a news article"

## Part 2

Submit the **raw response** from the LLM when you give it the simple task without any enhancements.


### Answer
*The raw response from the LLM*

**Response:**
```
The raw response from the LLM based on the simple prompt
```

**Example notes/idears:**
- How does the LLM respond to your unrefined prompt?
  - Is it too general or vague?
  - Does it miss important points or go off-topic?
- Are there noticeable issues (e.g., lack of clarity, missing details, inconsistent tone)?
  - Is the tone too casual or robotic?
  - Are there facts or structure missing?

## Part 3

Then, rewrite your prompt using the **4 T’s**:

- Define a **Role and Behavior** (Traits)
- Specify exactly what you want (Task)
- Indicate the **style of communication** (Tone)
- Define the **intended audience and purpose** (Target)

### Answer

**Example notes/idears:**
- How can we incorporate each of the 4 T’s into our prompt?
  - Traits: "Act as a creative writing coach" / "Be a helpful assistant"
  - Task: "Write a four-line rhyming poem about springtime"
  - Tone: "Make it cheerful and uplifting"
  - Target: "For young readers aged 8–10"
- How do we expect the refined prompt to improve the response?
  - More tailored language?
  - Better structure or emotional tone?

## Part 4

Submit the **refined prompt** and the improved response from the LLM.

### Answer
*The improved response from the LLM along with your refined prompt*


**Refined Prompt:**
```
The prompt you created using the 4 T's
```

**Improved Response:**
```
The improved response from the LLM based on the refined prompt
```

**Example notes/idears:**
- What are the key differences between our initial and refined prompts?
  - More descriptive prompt?
  - More specific output?
  - Clearer tone or audience alignment?

---

## Part 5

Reflect: What was better about the second response? What challenges did you face while crafting the improved prompt?

**Example notes/idears:**
- How did adding the 4 T’s enhance clarity, specificity, and tone?
    - Did the AI respond more like a “role” (e.g., teacher, poet, coder)?

- What improvements in the output (e.g., more details, better organization, targeted language) did we observe?
  - Did it feel more on-topic or engaging?

- Were there any difficulties in specifying the traits, task, tone, or target? How did we overcome them?
    - Was it hard to define the tone? The audience?

- How would we apply these learnings in future prompt designs?
    - What would we do differently next time?
    - Would we add more details or examples?


### Answer
*Write our reflection*
