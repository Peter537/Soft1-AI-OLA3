## Part 2

Submit the **raw response** from the LLM when you give it the simple task without any enhancements.


### Answer

**Response:**
```
Whispers of the Wild

Beneath the sky so vast and wide,
Where golden rays and clouds collide,
The earth awakens, soft and slow—
A living canvas set aglow.

The rivers hum a silver song,
Through valleys green they dance along,
While willows bow in breezy grace,
Their leaves like fingers brush my face.

The mountains stand with ancient pride,
Their snowy crowns the stars confide,
And every stone, and every tree,
Holds secrets of eternity.

The dawn arrives on sparrow wings,
With songs that only morning brings,
And in the hush of twilight's hush,
The world is cloaked in amber blush.

The flowers bloom with colors bold,
A painter’s dream in blue and gold,
And bees, like tiny travelers, roam—
Each petal pause a fleeting home.

Oh, nature speaks in silent art,
And gently mends the human heart.
No temple grand, no crafted dome,
Can match the wild, eternal home.
```

**Example notes/idears:**
- How does the LLM respond to your unrefined prompt?
  - Is it too general or vague?
  - Does it miss important points or go off-topic?
- Are there noticeable issues (e.g., lack of clarity, missing details, inconsistent tone)?
  - Is the tone too casual or robotic?
  - Are there facts or structure missing?


The LLM's response to the unrefined prompt is a poem about the beauty of nature, which is what we asked for.

## Part 3

Then, rewrite your prompt using the **4 T’s**:

- Define a **Role and Behavior** (Traits)
- Specify exactly what you want (Task)
- Indicate the **style of communication** (Tone)
- Define the **intended audience and purpose** (Target)

### Answer

**Example notes/idears:**
- How can we incorporate each of the 4 T’s into our prompt?
  - Traits: "Act as a creative writing coach" / "Be a helpful assistant"
  - Task: "Write a four-line rhyming poem about springtime"
  - Tone: "Make it cheerful and uplifting"
  - Target: "For young readers aged 8–10"
- How do we expect the refined prompt to improve the response?
  - More tailored language?
  - Better structure or emotional tone?


Our initial/unrefined prompt is too vague and lacks details specifics, due to the prompt also being short (1 line). Due to the nature of the task, writing a poem, it is not the hardest to incorporate the aspects of the 4 T's. This is because its a writing task, so fearly easy to say, e.g (traits) "act as a poet" or (tone) "make it gentle and reflective". Therefore, we expect the refined prompt to be more tailored to the task, and also more specific in the different aspects of the 4 T's.

**Refined Prompt:**
```
(Traits)
You are a thoughtful and imaginative poet with a deep appreciation for the natural world.

(Task)
Write a vivid and emotionally resonant poem that captures the beauty of nature through rich imagery and metaphor.

To clarify by 'vivid' we mean, that the poem should create clear, colorful, and detailed images in the reader's mind that evoke the sights, sounds, and feelings of being in nature. Fourthermore, by 'emotionally resonant' we mean that the poem should evoke feelings of wonder, peace, or connection to the natural world.

(Tone)
Use a gentle, reflective, and lyrical tone. Example of tone could be: 

"Beneath the hush of morning light,
the dew-kissed leaves begin to sway,
a robin sings the world awake,
and chases sleep’s last dream away.

(Target).
This poem is intended for an audience of nature lovers and poetry enthusiasts, aiming to inspire wonder and a deeper connection to the natural world.

## Part 4

Submit the **refined prompt** and the improved response from the LLM.

### Answer
*The improved response from the LLM along with your refined prompt*

**Improved Response:**
```
In the tender blush of dawn, the earth awakes
with whispers of a secret symphony—
each blade of grass a silent verse,
each dewdrop a note of sparkling light.

The sky spills hues of pastel dreams,
as the wind, like a gentle minstrel,
caresses the trembling leaves
in a delicate dance of ephemeral grace.

A river of memory meanders through the land,
carrying ancient tales of stone and time,
its murmur a lullaby to the weary soul,
a serenade that deepens the heart's quiet wonder.

Beneath the canopy of ancient trees,
where shadows embrace the sun’s soft glow,
I find solace in nature’s tender embrace—
a reminder that beauty endures
in the ever-changing, eternal rhythm of life.
```

**Example notes/idears:**
- What are the key differences between our initial and refined prompts?
  - More descriptive prompt?
  - More specific output?
  - Clearer tone or audience alignment?

The key differences between the initial and refined prompts are, that we included more details about the desired traits, task, tone, and target audience in the refined prompt, where in the initial there was non. We made sure of being specific in the different aspects of the 4 T's, and also provided examples of different aspects like tone.

## Part 5

Reflect: What was better about the second response? What challenges did you face while crafting the improved prompt?

**Example notes/idears:**
- How did adding the 4 T’s enhance clarity, specificity, and tone?
    - Did the AI respond more like a “role” (e.g., teacher, poet, coder)?

- What improvements in the output (e.g., more details, better organization, targeted language) did we observe?
  - Did it feel more on-topic or engaging?

- Were there any difficulties in specifying the traits, task, tone, or target? How did we overcome them?
    - Was it hard to define the tone? The audience?

- How would we apply these learnings in future prompt designs?
    - What would we do differently next time?
    - Would we add more details or examples?


### Answer

In the incorporation of the 4 T's, it was challenging to define the tone, and give a clear example of it, beacuse we ourself are not poets. So we had to do some extra prompt give an example of tone. This is an important aspect when using AI, its easy to use, but also hard when you have to be specific but your knowledge is limited, as in this case, where we are not poets. 

In the future, we would try to be more specific in the different aspects of the 4 T's. For example, we could have added more details in which nature aspects we wanted to focus on, e.g. trees, flowers, rivers, etc. or just locations, e.g. forest, mountains, etc. This would have made the prompt even more specific and tailored to our needs.
